    <h3 class="heading">Rory J. Weichbrod Unfinished Business, Inc</h3>
    <p>
      Rory Joseph Weichbrod was a 26-year-old man whose life was ended October 10, 2010 when he was crossing a suburban Maryland street and was struck by a speeding car driven by a drunk driver.  A close friend accompanying him also was killed.  Their names were added to the ever-growing list of innocent victims whose lives are taken by drunk drivers. We see, hear and read about such tragedies almost daily.  Quite honestly, most people, while they may lament the senseless loss of lives, tend to view the victims as merely additional statistics to be used in the fight against drunk driving. They see or read about the tragedy, are momentarily affected and then get on with their daily lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the effect is a whole lot different when it’s personal, when the victim is a family member.  Rory was my older brother and my best friend.  I looked to him for guidance, for comfort and for inspiration.  He was a gregarious, outgoing, fun-loving guy who could light up a room and enliven a gathering by his very presence.  Best of all, he was a caring, compassionate human being who truly believed in extending a helping hand to others, especially those less fortunate.  He was my parents’ oldest son of four children and a tremendous source of pride to all of us because of who and what he was.  Words cannot describe our sense of loss; we miss him each and every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rory’s life was cut short as a result of one man’s decision to drink and drive.  His untimely passing left many of his life goals unfinished.  To ensure that the memory of Rory and his spirit is kept alive, we established Rory J. Weichbrod Unfinished Business, Inc. (RJW) as a non-profit, charitable organization in July 2011.  Its purpose is to promote responsible drinking and to raise public awareness to the dangers of drinking and driving through various community-enhancing events, including the annual Best of the Best 5K Run.  In addition, Unfinished Business will award annual scholarships to young scholars who best embody Rory’s qualities of caring, compassion, humility and honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      This charitable organization consists of a volunteer Board of Directors who are dedicated to its mission and goals.  It has been granted 501(c)(3) status by the Internal Revenue Service and is recognized as a public charity.  Contributions to Rory J. Weichbrod Unfinished Business, Inc. are tax deductible as allowed by the IRS.
